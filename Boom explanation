What is Boom in hapi js 
Boom is a tiny library that works with (but also outside) Hapi.js. It's used for creating standardized HTTP error responses easily.
It helps to have clean and structured error messages 
Example 
const Boom = require('@hapi/boom');

// Create a 404 Not Found error
const notFoundError = Boom.notFound('This page does not exist.');

console.log(notFoundError.output);
Other Boom error handling functions 
Method	HTTP Status	Description
Boom.badRequest(message)	400	Invalid request from client
Boom.unauthorized(message)	401	Authentication failure
Boom.forbidden(message)	403	Authenticated but not allowed
Boom.notFound(message)	404	Resource not found
Boom.internal(message)	500	Internal server error
Boom.conflict(message)	409	Conflict (e.g., duplicate entry)
